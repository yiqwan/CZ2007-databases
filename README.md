# CZ2007 Introduction to databases

- This is a course that I have taken in year 2 NTU.

- The lab project consists of 6 members.

- The lab manual and folders for each lab submission are available 

## My contributions

- Everyone's contributions was similar for lab 1 and 3 where we designed the ER diagram and relational schema.

- In lab 5, I mainly generated fake data to populate the tables with python libraries such as pandas, faker and numpy. After generating the data, I also helped to debug some of the queries in SQL alongside with my teammates.

- I was the leader for this project, so I also made project roadmaps and summaries for other teammates to refer to.
